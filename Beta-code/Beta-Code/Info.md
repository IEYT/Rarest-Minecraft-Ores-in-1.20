you can't run this with vs code terminal, i don't know why but to run this code , you must use this code on powershell " cd (the drive your files are on ie.(C:))/(the folder where you store the file), run it then," " python (the drive your files are on ie.(C:))/(the folder where you store the file)/(The Rarest-Minecraft-Ores.py file) ". Then the app will open. Thank you for your time!
